    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Located in the center of Beijing, Beihai Park covers an area of 690,000 square meters, including 390,000 square meters for water. It was called Yaoyu (literally the Isle of Precious Jade) in the Liao Dynasty and was established in 1166AD (the 6th year of Dading period of the Jin Dynasty). It used to be a royal place for sightseeing, government affairs handling and sacrifice by emperors and the imperial families of the Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. It is the earliest and best-preserved imperial garden in the world.

The Round City occupies an area of 4,500 square meters, surrounded by a 4.6-meter high and 276-meter long city wall. After the founding of the People 's Republic of China, the Round City was rebuilt. In 1961, both the Round City and Beihai Park were listed by the State Council as Key National Cultural Heritage Sites.
